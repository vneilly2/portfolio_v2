        <p class="bio-text">I bring strong problem-solving and analytical skills that augment my technical skill set and experience in front-end web development. Coupled with my focused and positive demeanor, my strong work ethic has yielded positive feedback from both users and clients of websites I have worked on. During my 7+ years in the website design and development field, I have had the opportunity to strengthen my knowledge of front-end languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, jQuery, and Bootstrap AngularJS and most recently a dedicated concentration on ReactJS. In addition, I have had exposure to Backbone.js, Underscore.js and Socket.io.</p>
